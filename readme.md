The United States Social Security Administration has made available data on the 
 frequency of baby names from 1880 through the present. 
 Download names.zip from ssa.gov (linked below) and unpack into your 
 working directory. 
 Create a Python callable which accepts 
 - the year, 
 - a number n
 - optionally whether to include only male or female names; 
this callable should 
 - return a list of the top n names in that year 
 - (filtered down to only male or female, if requested by the optional argument). 
 You are welcome to add additional functionality to your program, and use of library modules is permitted.
